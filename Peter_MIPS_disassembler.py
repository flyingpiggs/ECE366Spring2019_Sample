# UIC, ECE366, Spring 2019
# Instructor: Wenjing Rao
# Code sample for homework2
# A disassembler that supports the MIPS instructions sub, ori, and lw. 
# Note: disassembler goes from machine code to assembly 

# Details of the supported instructions:
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# LW -- Load word
# Description: A word is loaded into a register from the specified address.
# Operation: $t = MEM[$s + offset]; advance_pc (4);
# Syntax: lw $t, offset($s)
# Encoding: 1000 11ss ssst tttt iiii iiii iiii iiii 
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ORI -- Bitwise or immediate
# Description: Bitwise ors a register and an immediate value and stores the result in a register
# Operation: $t = $s | imm; advance_pc (4);
# Syntax: ori $t, $s, imm
# Encoding: 0011 01ss ssst tttt iiii iiii iiii iiii 
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# SUB -- Subtract
# Description: Subtracts two registers and stores the result in a register
# Operation: $d = $s - $t; advance_pc (4);
# Syntax: sub $d, $s, $t
# Encoding: 0000 00ss ssst tttt dddd d000 0010 0010
